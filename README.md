# whatsapp-export-google-docs-link
When a whatsapp chat is exported, it contains a txt file and other filetypes. In the main txt file, there are references to the additional files (images,video) but they are not easily accessed.  Especially for legal cases, you want a Google document with hyperlinked resources in the Google drive folder, this small script will do this for you.


#Pre-requisities
- You have a whatsapp chat export
- The export folder contains a main txt file and supporting files
- You have a Google account and are able to upload the entire folder to Google Drive
